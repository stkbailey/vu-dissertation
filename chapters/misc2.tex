\chapter{How To Use This LaTeX Template: Advanced}
This chapter will discuss briefly other topics important to dissertation completion. Specifically, how to handle lists of figures and tables, as well as how to generate acronyms/abbreviations. Inserting references will also be discussed.

\section{ Lists of Figures, Tables, and Acronyms}
Lists of figures and tables should be built automatically from the figures and tables you insert in this document. The list of acronyms is also generated automatically, but acronyms must be defined before they can be added to a list of acronyms. See the \nomenclature{VDF}{Vanderbilt Dissertation Format} VanderbiltDissertationFormat.tex (VDF) file for an example of how to insert an acronym appropriately. Note that there are numerous ways within LaTeX to manage lists of acronyms. This template utilizes the nomencl package.

\section{Using References}
There are numerous methods to insert references into your document. Please refer to the VanderbiltDissertationFormat.tex file to see how references were added to this document and how the Bibliography was generated.
