\chapter{Reorganization of network architecture during reading}

\epigraph{}{}

\section{Motivation}

While resting-state functional connectivity is thought to provide insights into a relatively stable ``intrinsic'' architecture, \textit{task-evoked} functional connectivity measures network properties after reorganization to a new, more useful organization for the task \citep{Cohen2016}. While there are constraints to the degree of reconfiguration which can be related to other aspects of brain structure, including structural connectivity via white matter tracts and cortical thickeness and folding \citep{Sui2014}, there is a great degree of flexibility as well \citep{Cole2013}. One study, for example, compared a finger-tapping to working memory task. Using measures of modularity and participation coefficient, they found that within-network communication was critical for the motor task, whereas between-network communication was important for working memory \citep{Cohen2016}. This supports a hypothesis that, for a given task, there is an optimal organization, and that individuals who can better rewire their intrinsic systems to fit this organization will be more effective. 

% Reorganization may also index reading skill
Understanding how the brain reconfigures during reading, and its relationship to the network architecture at rest, is critical for understanding how connectome-level properties set individuals up to be better readers. In Study 1, we found that global modularity is positively related to reading skill, even when controlling for verbal intelligence and motion. The inference is that global modularity is indicative of a brain organization that is more tuned to pass the information between the disparate systems needed for reading. According to one line of reasoning, modularity is indicative of a relatively stable platform for integrating multiple different areas. 

% Effects on network organization during reading
Since reading, and especially reading comprehension, is a heavily integrative task, it must induce a much more integrated architeecture. Although global activity patterns have been described \citep{Rimrodt2009, Xu2006} global connectivity patterns, and how the measures of segregation and integration change during reading, have not. There have also been no accounts of how brain activity corresponds to measures of participation; that is, whether activation in the traditional sense corresponds to increased engagement with many areas, or if it reflects primarily local processing. This may be dependent on RSN: that is, visual areas may be more likely to perform local processing, whereas FPN areas may be more important for transferring information. 

% Reading skill
A subsequent question is whether the relationship between reading skill and network modularity \textit{while reading} should remain the same. One hypothesis is that, if cross-network communication is critical to reading, better readers should exhibit a much less modular organization while reading than poor readers. However, there is evidence from univariate analyses of brain activation that would suggest the opposite: compared to poor readers, expert readers show \textit{less} activation in many reading-related areas during reading tasks \citep{Christodoulou2014}.  In the context of interactive specialization, this is explained by the increased efficiency of information transfer within an established network. 

% This study's objectives
Investigating RSN interactions during reading is thus an excellent model system for understanding how changes to network architecture enable fluency in a specific cognitive skill. In the present study, we investigate the effects of reading comprehension on network architecture, and how it is modulated by reading skill. First, we validate our task with a traditional univariate analysis. Next, we describe the global changes to different aspects of network architecture during each condition. Then, we pinpoint which brain areas and RSNs that drive the changes to network architecture, and investgate the relationship between these changes and individual differences in reading skill. 


\section{Methods}

\subsection{Participants}

Participants were drawn from the same cohort of subjects included in Study 1, and identical inclusion criteria for both demographic and scan motion were applied. However, additional measures related to the performance of the task were levied as described below. A total of 47 unique subjects and 88 scan sessions were included in the analysis. Their demographics are described in Table \ref{table:ch3-participants}.

\end{table}


\subsection{MRI acquisition and task design}

Participants performed up to four runs of a language comprehension task, which was crossed on two conditions: the modality of presentation (listening or reading) and the passage genre (expository or narrative). Functional MRI acquisition parameters were identical to Study 1 with the exception of scan duration, which was increased to a total of 250 dynamic volumes for each run. 

For the present analysis, only the ``reading'' scans were considered, and the effects of genre on brain activation were ignored, as they are balanced out within the majority of subjects. (6 subjects had only a single genre used for analysis.) In the following paragraphs, however, we will describe the experiment design in its entirety, as it will be relevant to subsequent analyses.

Each fMRI run had two baseline conditions: a modality-specific baseline task and a resting-state block with a fixation cross. At the conclusion of the comprehension portion of each experiment, two images were presented, and subjects were asked to decide if the image was related to the passage. (e.g., Is a picture of a cake with candles related to a story about a birthday party?) The order and duration for each block varied slightly across runs but was approximately: paragraph 1 (60 s), baseline 1 (60 s), paragraph 2 (60 s), baseline 2 (60 s), and resting-state (270 s). Total scan time was 550 s for each run. See Fig. \ref{fig:ch3-task-design} for a schematic describing the visual task.

\begin{figure}[t]

Subjects were presented two blocks of passage reading and a symbol comparison tasks, which were followed by a brief comprehension question and a resting block. Starred stimuli in the reading and attention conditions represent ``repeat'' stimuli, and a participant is asked to click a button when they detect one. The total duration of each scan run was 550 seconds.}
	\label{fig:ch3-task-design}
\end{figure}

To create a more naturalistic reading experience than single word presentation \citep{Rayner1998}, passages were presented in syntactic phrases ranging from 1-7 words in length. The interval between each stimulus was jittered to allow for event-related analyses (range: 275 â€“ 4000 ms), although these effects were not examined here.

The sensory baseline condition was altered according to modality. For the reading runs, three non-alphanumeric symbols were displayed horizontally (two types), and their presentation time was matched to the passage phrases. Spacing between symbols was randomly alternated to replicate the variable phrase lengths in the passage condition. For the listening runs, three tones (two frequencies) were played in sequence, with a new set of tones beginning at the same intervals as the corresponding passage presentation. 

To monitor attention, 4 to 8 percent of the stimuli within each passage or attention block were randomly repeated on two consecutive screens.  Participants pressed a button with their right thumb when they detected a repeated phrase, symbol or tone configuration. Additionally, at the conclusion of each passage, a picture was presented on the screen, and subjects were asked to identify whether the picture had any relationship to the passage (e.g., a picture of a mushroom for a passage about fungi). 

To assess performance, we analyzed three measures: in-scanner attention, in-scanner comprehension, and post-scan recall. To assess attention for the ``repeated stimulus'' task, we used the $D`$ summary measure. It is calculated as:

$$
D^\prime = Z_{true\ positive} - Z_{false\ positive}
$$

Individual scan runs with a $D`$ value less than 2 were excluded from analysis. The in-scanner comprehension measure was the number (either 0, 1, or 2) of questions correctly answered. To assess recall after the scan, each child was asked to recite as much of the passage as they could remember, and their answers were mapped to actual phrases present in the chapter. 

In total, there were 4 passages (2 listening and 2 reading), each leveled to a third grade difficulty level and balanced on word measures such as concreteness and cohesiveness.  All subjects were trained on the task in a mock scanner prior to the actual scan. 


\subsection{Activation analyses}

Whole-brain fMRI analyses were performed using tools from the FMRIB Software Library (version 5.0.9). For each session, the following pre-processing steps were performed:  slice-time correction, motion correction to the initial fMRI volume, high-pass filtering at 0.08 Hz, boundary-based registration to the subject's structural image, and normalization to 2 mm MNI 152 standard space. To mitigate the effects of motion on our analyses, we regressed out 6 continuous motion parameters and scrubbed out outlier volumes. We defined an outlier volume as any in which the root-mean-square framewise displacement exceeded 0.7 mm. We removed scan runs where more than 20 percent of the fMRI volumes were considered outliers.

All task conditions were convolved with the double-gamma hemodynamic response function to generate design matrices for each fMRI run. Two first-level contrasts were of interest: the main effect of passage comprehension (``Reading vs. Rest''), and the contrast of passage comprehension vs. the sensory baseline (``Reading vs. Attention''). Repeated stimuli and the picture comprehension task were modelled out.

Reading effects were estimated at the subject-level using fixed effects analysis. These were carried over into group-level analyses using non-parametric methods implemented in FSLâ€™s \textit{randomise} tool with threshold-free cluster enhancement. For each group-level analysis, we performed 5000 permutations and report results with \textit{p} \textless 0.05. 

To understand our univariate results as a function of system-level activation, we also extracted activation values from each of the 264 connectome nodes, and summarized the activity of each ``intrinsic'' RSN.

\subsection{Network analyses}

For graph theory analyses, network estimation was performed in the \textit{Conn: Functional Connectivity Toolbox} (version 17f) \citep{WhitfieldGabrieli2012}. As in Study 1, for each scan run, the BOLD activity at each node was denoised using the anatomical CompCorr method, which regresses out background noise from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid tissue. We also regressed out 12 continuous measures of motion were also included, all outlier timepoints, and the effect of all task conditions (``Reading'', ``Attention'', ``Rest''). The timeseries was then high-pass filtered at 0.01 Hz.

Whole-brain connectomes for each condition were created by estimating the functional connectivity between each node using a weighted general linear model. For connection-level analyses, these values were compared directly across subjects and conditions. For graph theory analyses, the array of all node connections was thresholded to keep the top 5 percent of connections, resulting in a much sparser representation. This threshold was also tested at ranges from 2 percent to 10 percent. These arrays were then characterized using the previously described graph theory measures: modularity, participation coefficient, and path length.

To investigate the ``rewiring'' of the network at the RSN-level, we compared the number of connections across each RSN relationship at each condition. For each pair of networks, we computed a paired $t$-test between the total number of connections between the networks to determine whether there were more in one or the other condition. This resulted in a 13 by 13 RSN-level connectivity array. Connectivity changes were performed at eaech of the 9 thresholds, and relationships that showed significant changes ($p < 0.05$, uncorrected) in at least 7 of the 9 thresholds were included in the rewiring diagram.


\section{Results}

47 subjects (88 scan runs) met the attention and motion criteria for inclusion in the analysis. (5 subjects and 15 scan runs were excluded.) The distribution of performance and motion criteria are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:ch3-task-performance}.

\subsection{Activation results}

A range of language-related areas were activated during reading comprehension (Fig. \ref{fig:ch3-reading-brain-activation}). Compared to the attention baseline, reading-related activation spanned the inferior frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, premotor cortex, middle temporal gyrus and the superior frontal gyrus. Activation patterns were robustly present on both hemispheres but extended further and with greater intensity on the left hemisphere. There were also a number of areas that were more active in the sensory and resting state, particularly in the dorsal attention network and anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

The above figures show axial, coronal and sagittal views of the ``reading vs. attention'' activation contrast.

Results are thresholded at $p < 0.05$ using threshold-free cluster enhancement (5000 permutations).}
	\label{fig:ch3-reading-brain-activations}
\end{figure}

To understand RSN-level trends in activation, we also examined the results when projected onto the 264 nodes in the connectome parcellation. Compared to the resting baseline, the ventral attention, visual and default mode networks had the greatest number of ``activated'' nodes. It is also notable that the ``uncertain'' nodes were highly engaged. `These nodes had variable activity that made them impossible to classify consistently in the original paper \citep{Power2011}. Their engagement may reflect the important role of functionally diverse regions in the execution of reading comprehension. On the other end, the memory retrieval, salience and cingulo-opercular networks exhibited decreased activity compared to rest. See Figure \ref{ch3-reading-connectome-activations} for a diagram of these activations by RSN.

Cingulo-opercular, memory retrieval and salience networks showed decreases. Dashed lines represent $p < 0.05$, uncorrected.}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Network results}

Next, we examined changes to global network architecture. Figure \ref{fig:ch3-comprehension-graph-theory-all} summarizes the subject-level changes in modularity, participation coefficient, and path length. Overall, the effect was one of increased integration across RSNs during reading comprehension. Relative to rest, both reading comprehension and the sensory baseline reduced the global modularity and increased the participation coefficient. The magnitude of the effect in reading comprehension was also greater than that of the sensory condition. The path length within each RSN did not significantly change across condition, suggesting that the modular organization of the brain was not disrupted; the RSN parcellation used was still a good fit. However, there were significant increases in the between-RSN path length corresponding to greater efficiency of transferring information between these disparate systems.

    \caption[Reading induces more integrated global network architecture.]{Reading induces more integrated global network architecture.

Notably, the only measure not significantly changed during task was the within-RSN path length.}
	\label{fig:ch3-comprehension-graph-theory-all}
\end{figure}

Network-level trends in task-evoked differences, presented in Figure   \ref{fig:ch3-rsn-condition-effects}, were largely consistent with global effects. However, a few findings are worth noting: compared to rest, reading was marked by large decreases in modularity of the visual, dorsal attention and default mode networks. However, the increases to participation coefficient were global. Compared to the attention task, network-level changes were modest, and the global differences were driven by reduced modularity in the default mode and fronto-parietal networks and increased participation of memory retrieval and default mode networks.

\end{figure}


The relationships between global and RSN-level graph theory effects become more clear when examining the ``rewiring'' diagram comparing rest and reading (Fig. \ref{fig:ch3-comprehension-reorganization}). During rest, there are many more within-module connections in the sensory systems, dorsal attention and default mode networks. During reading, however, between-network connections increase across many between-network relationships and none within-network relationships. That is, the brain becomes more integrated.

	\label{fig:ch3-comprehension-reorganization}
\end{figure}

Decreases in modularity are coupled by increases in the participation of specific nodes. To address whether the areas that are activated during reading (in the traditional univariate sense) are also the areas driving integration, we correlated the two variables at the node level. Interestingly, we found that nodes that were more activated in reading tended to be those with lower participation coefficients ($r = -0.434$, $p < 0.001$). Nodes with high participation coefficients tended to be deactivated relative to rest, although a few of these hub-like areas were also activated. This effect can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:ch3-node-participation-to-activation}).

\end{figure}


Finally, we sought to replicate our previous finding relating resting-state modularity with reading, and to determine whether this relationship would change in the task-evoked network. For each task condition, we regressed the global modularity against the TOWRE Total Word Efficiency standard score. The results are found in Figure \ref{fig;ch3-modularity-reading-by-condition}. We replicated the results of Study 1 using the shorter rest condition from our task ($r_{rest} = 0.432$, $p < 0.01$), and also found that the same relationship  held in the other conditions ($r_{attention} = 0.447$, $p < 0.01$; $r_{reading} = 0.494$, $p < 0.01$). There was no relationship between reading skill and the change in modularity between reading and rest, however.

\section{Discussion}

% Restatement of purpose and results
The current study sought to determine in what ways task-evoked functinoal network architecture during reading differs from that of rest and a simple attention task, and whether a less modular network while reading was predictive of better reading skill. As expected, we found that reading activated areas throughout the brain, and especially in the visual, ventral attention and default mode networks, and it increased measures of integration throughout the brain compared to rest and a simple visual task. We also found that the areas with high participation coefficients tended to be deactivated  and that decreases in modularity in the sensory, dorsal attention and default mode areas drove the global changes in modularity observed during reading. Finally, we found that the positive direction of the relationship between modularity and reading skill was unchanged at rest and in task.

% Overall significance 
Overall, the results suggest that the maintenance of an efficient network organization, i.e. one in which brain areas form clusters connected by hub regions, is important for skilled reading, even as between-network connectivity increases. To our knowledge, this is the first time the relationship between modularity and hubness to reading skill has been described during reading, adding to a foundation of work built on other connectivity methods, and it provides a secondary replication of the resting-state findings described in Study 1.

% Distribution of activity among different RSNs
One insight gained in this study is that much of the ``reading network'' falls in domain-general RSNs such as the attention and executive networks. While these areas perform a specific function in reading, they are also often involved in other processes. For example, the dorsal attention network encompasses the visual word form area, an area that has been the subject of much interest and debate in reading and dyslexia research \citep{McCandliss2003}. It is probable that this area is so important in reading not only because it is connected to language areas \citep{Bouhali2014}, but also because it is tightly tied to other areas that control goal-directed attention \citep{Vogel2014}. Koyama and colleagues found that children with a historical diagnosis of dyslexia had persistent de-coupling of the DAN compared to typical readers regardless of remediation status \citep{Koyama2013}. Vogel et al. found that reading ability in typical children and adults (including decoding and passage comprehension ability) predicted increased correlations between the visual word form area and the DAN \citep{Vogel2012a}. The nesting of this orthographic-processing area within the DAN is thus important to its role in reading.

% Changes to global modularity, but no changes to reading correlation
In terms of global network effects, we found that tasks reduced global measures of modularity and increasd measures of between-RSN communication, including participation coefficient and path length. Relative to rest, this was most apparent in the visual RSN, which was characterized by a massive decrease in modularity compared to rest. These findings support a model in which the modular architecture of the brain is highly maintained between tasks, and the maintenance of this modularity is important for cognitive skill. It is not yet possible to say whether modularity within these specific RSNs correlates most highly with reading because of their functional roles in reading processes or whether they simply capture global trends better than other networks. There is some reason to suspect specificity, however. In studies of remediation-induced changes to connectivity, increased connectivity within the visual network \citep{Koyama2013} and cingulo-opercular network \citep{HorowitzKraus2015} have predicted reading improvement in dyslexic children. 

% Participation coefficient
It is perhaps surprising to see primarily global effects of condition on the participation coefficient. Other work has found that certain networks, such as the fronto-parietal network are responsible for task-switching \citep{Cole2013}. Previous research have also noted that brain regions that have been found to be abnormal in dyslexia localize on high-hub regions \citep{Bailey2018}. However, the literature on dyslexia may be insightful here: several of these regions, including the inferior frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule have been found to be both active in some studies and inactive in others. It is perhaps, then, an abnormality in the system rather than underactivation. The anti-correlation between task activity and participation coefficient highlights the complementary nature of network analysis with activation analyses. What it suggests is that ``hub'' regions have a primary role as connectors, whereas only in some cases are regions active and highly participatory. 

% Conclusions and next steps
Taken together, these results suggest that the modular network architecture of the brain is relatively stable across task-evoked and resting states, lending further credence to assertions that it measures an intrinsic property. One major limitation of the present approach is that effects were measured at a global level using the resting-network parcellation. While this allows for reproducibility and an interpretable RSN ``rewiring'' framework, it cannot capture or describe the presence of new communities. It is also unable to compare individuals against each other; it assumes a reference framework. Other analytical methods, such as investigating the number of shared connection between two connectomes may provide a more detailed insight into variability in task-evoked connectomes \citep{Petersen2016}. We will address this question of to what degree individual connectomes change across a wider variety of tasks in the next chapter.
