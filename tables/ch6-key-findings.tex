 \ref{fig:ch2-network-graph-theory-descriptions} & Reading shows greater activation in many linguistic areas.	\\ 
\ref{fig:ch2-network-graph-theory-descriptions} & Language increases connectivity between RSNs globally, compared to rest and baseline attention.	 \\ 
\ref{fig:ch2-network-graph-theory-descriptions} & Reading has higher integration, drivn largely by de-clustering of visual areas.\\
